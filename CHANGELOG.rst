1.4.0-M2
========

This version depends on yaidom 1.4.0-M2.


1.4.0-M1

This version depends on yaidom 1.4.0-M1.


1.3.6

1.3.5
=====

This version depends on yaidom 1.3.5.


1.3.4
=====

This version depends on yaidom 1.3.4.


1.3.3
=====

This version depends on yaidom 1.3.3.

Moreover, added some XPointer support (in XBRL context).


1.3.2
=====

This version depends on yaidom 1.3.2.


1.3.1
=====

This version depends on yaidom 1.3.1.


1.3
===

This version depends on yaidom 1.3.

Moreover, support has been added for so-called "bridge elements" (useful in several projects that model an XML dialect),
and XBRL linkbases have been modeled (and XLink as restricted by XBRL has been modeled as well).

In time, the old xlink package content will be phased out.


1.2
===

This version depends on yaidom 1.2.


1.1
===

This version depends on yaidom 1.1.


1.0
===

This version depends on yaidom 1.0.


0.8.2
=====

This version depends on yaidom 0.8.2, and defaults to Scala 2.11.


0.8.1
=====

This version depends on yaidom 0.8.1, and therefore adds support for Scala 2.11.X.
It also made ``labeledResources`` and ``labeledLocators`` in extended links "vals", to speed up lookups within extended links,
at the expense of more expensive creation of extended links.


0.8.0
=====

This version depends on yaidom 0.8.0, and therefore drops support for Scala 2.9.X.


0.7.0
=====

Version 0.7.0, copied from yaidom 0.6.14. Note that starting with yaidom 0.7.0, XLink support has been moved to this separate project.
