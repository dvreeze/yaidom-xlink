CHANGELOG
=========


1.0
===

This version depends on yaidom 1.0.


0.8.2
=====

This version depends on yaidom 0.8.2, and defaults to Scala 2.11.


0.8.1
=====

This version depends on yaidom 0.8.1, and therefore adds support for Scala 2.11.X.
It also made ``labeledResources`` and ``labeledLocators`` in extended links "vals", to speed up lookups within extended links,
at the expense of more expensive creation of extended links.


0.8.0
=====

This version depends on yaidom 0.8.0, and therefore drops support for Scala 2.9.X.


0.7.0
=====

Version 0.7.0, copied from yaidom 0.6.14. Note that starting with yaidom 0.7.0, XLink support has been moved to this separate project.
