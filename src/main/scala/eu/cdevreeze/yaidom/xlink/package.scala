/**
 * XLink support, in an XBRL context.
 *
 * The XLink class and its sub-classes in this package are legacy that will be phased out. They model "XLink as XLink",
 * without any restrictions imposed by XBRL. They also wrap only yaidom "simple elements". Both properties make these
 * classes less useful in an XBRL context.
