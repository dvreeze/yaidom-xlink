/**
 * Bridge element that extends `IndexedBridgeElem` with "document-awareness".
 *
 * It offers pluggable DOM-like element implementations, without any "type gymnastics" and without paying any
 * "cake pattern tax".
 *
 * Note that in yaidom, generics have been used extensively for composable pieces of the query API, in order to
 * assemble these into concrete element implementations. Here we use abstract types, in order to make concrete element
 * implementations pluggable as "XML back-ends". The goal is different, and so is the mechanism (abstract types
 * instead of type parameters).
 *
 * This is a purely abstract universal trait, allowing for allocation-free value objects.
