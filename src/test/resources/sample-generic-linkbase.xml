				Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
			</b>
			<p>
				To the Board of Directors and Shareowners
			</p>
			<p>
				of ACME Corporation:
			</p>
			<p>
				We have examined the accompanying XBRL-Related Documents of ACME
				Corporation (the "Corporation"), which reflect the data presented in
				the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter and
				six-months ended December 31, 2007. The Corporation’s management is
				responsible for the XBRL-Related Documents. Our responsibility is to
				express an opinion based on our examination.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have also reviewed, in accordance with the standards of the Public
				Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the financial
				statements of the Corporation as of December 31, 2007, and for the
				three and six-month periods then ended, the objective of which was
				the expression of limited assurance on such financial statements,
				and issued our report thereon dated April 1, 2007. A review of
				financial statements is substantially less in scope than an audit
				conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
				Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which
				is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements
				taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				In addition, we have previously audited, in accordance with the
				standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
				States), the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2007, and the
				related consolidated statements of operations, of cash flows and of
				changes in shareowners’ equity for the year then ended, management’s
				assessment of the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal
				control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2007 and the
				effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial
				reporting as of June 30, 2007, and in our report dated August 31,
				2007, except for Notes 1, 10 and 16 for which the date is May 6,
				2005, we expressed unqualified opinions thereon. We were not engaged
				to and did not conduct a review of the information contained in Part
				I, Items 2, 3 and 4 and Part II, Items 1, 2 and 6 of the
				Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter and
				nine-months ended December 31, 2007, the objective of which would
				have been the expression of limited assurance on such aforementioned
				information. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion or any other
				assurance on such aforementioned information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our examination of the XBRL-Related Documents was conducted in
				accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
				Oversight Board (United States) and, accordingly, included
				examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the XBRL-Related
				Documents. Our examination also included evaluating the XBRL-Related
				Documents for conformity with the applicable XBRL taxonomies and
				specifications and the content and format requirements of the
				Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that our examination
				provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
			</p>
			<p>
				In our opinion, the XBRL-Related Documents of the Corporation referred
				to above accurately reflect, in all material respects, the data
				presented in the Corporation’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
				quarter and six months ended December 31, 2007, in conformity with
				the US GAAP—Commercial and Industrial Taxonomy, US Financial
				Reporting—Management’s Discussion and Analysis Taxonomy, US
				Financial Reporting—Accountant’s Report Taxonomy, US Financial
				Reporting—SEC Certifications Taxonomy, extensions specific to ACME
				Corporation, and the XBRL Specifications (Version 2.1).
